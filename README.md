# Greetings!

This is the repository for my personal website and blog.

Feel free to use and/or edit the theme/code. If you do, I would appreciate a shoutout!

The articles in this repository are licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and may be shared and altered so long as a link to the source is provided and the author (me) is accredited. Check out `LICENCE.md` for more details.

### Note on GitHub Pages:
GitHub Pages doesn't allow for custom Ruby plugins. This means that my method of generating pages for each category and tag will not work. To get around this, I am forced to generate the site locally and push the generated assets to the repository. To get GitHub Paged to play nice with Jekyll, I've added a `.nojekyll` file at the root of this repository, then changed Jekyll's destination directory to `docs`, and made `docs` the source directory for GitHub Pages.
